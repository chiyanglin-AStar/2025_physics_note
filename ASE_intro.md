## ASE is an ***Atomic Simulation Environment*** written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. The ASE has been constructed with a number of “design goals” that make it:

### Easy to use:

Setting up an atomistic total energy calculation or molecular dynamics simulation with ASE is simple and straightforward. ASE can be used via a graphical user interface, Command line tool and the Python language. Python scripts are easy to follow (see What is Python? for a short introduction). It is simple for new users to get access to all of the functionality of ASE.

### Flexible:

Since ASE is based on the Python scripting language it is possible to perform very complicated simulation tasks without any code modifications. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of simple “for-loop” constructions. There exist ASE modules for performing many standard simulation tasks.

### Customizable:

The Python code in ASE is structured in modules intended for different purposes. There are ase.calculators for calculating energies, forces and stresses, ase.md and ase.optimize modules for controlling the motion of atoms, constraints objects and filters for performing nudged-elastic-band calculations etc. The modularity of the object-oriented code make it simple to contribute new functionality to ASE.

### Pythonic:

It fits nicely into the rest of the Python world with use of the popular NumPy package for numerical work (see Numeric arrays in Python for a short introduction). The use of the Python language allows ASE to be used both interactively as well as in scripts.
